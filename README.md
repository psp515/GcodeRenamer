# GcodeRenamer

Simple .NET MAUI project, that enables formatting gcode files names to specified format for 3d prinetrs.
This app finds gcode files in selected folders and provides to rename it with some formats.

Why I made this app?
When I'am printing something on my 3d printer and i forget to properly format file names i don't know 
how long print does take and formatting It is time consuming.

## How App Works
- First you pass some routes where gcode files are stored.
- You select files to convert, and sets file conversion.
- Click Convert Files and Wait 
- After everything is finished in each selected file directory is created directory with converted files to specified format and filament.
