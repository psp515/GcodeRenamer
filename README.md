# GcodeRenamer

Simple .NET MAUI project, that enables formatting gcode files names to specified format for 3d prinetrs.
This app finds gcode files in selected folders and provides to rename it with some formats.

Why I made this app?
When I'am printing something on my 3d printer and i forget to properly format file names i don't know 
how long print does take and formatting It is time consuming. But slicers like Ultimaker Cura writes 
used time and used length and that enables to simply format file name.
